//Use Case 1: Application Entry & Welcome Message
//Goal: Establish a clear and predictable starting point for the Hotel Booking application by demonstrating how a Java program begins execution and produces console output.

//Actor: User – runs the application from the command line or IDE.

//Flow:

//User runs the application.
//JVM invokes the main() method.
//Application prints a welcome message along with the application name and version.
//Application terminates.
//Key Concepts Used
//Class - Even the simplest Java application must be defined inside a class.
//The class acts as a container for application behavior and marks the logical boundary of the program.
//main() Method - The main method is the entry point of every standalone Java application. The JVM looks specifically for the method signature:
//public static void main(String[] args).
//static Keyword - The main() method is declared static so that it can be executed without creating an object of the class.
//This allows the JVM to start execution directly.
//Console Output - System.out.println() is used to send text output to the console.
//This is the simplest way to observe program behavior during early development.
//String Literals - Text enclosed in double quotes (e.g., "Hotel Booking System v1.0") is treated as a String literal, which is immutable and stored in the String pool.
//Method Invocation - Calling println() on the out object demonstrates how methods are invoked on objects in Java, even in basic programs.
//Application Flow - Execution proceeds top to bottom inside the main() method unless altered by control structures.
//This use case reinforces linear execution flow.
//JavaDoc Comments - JavaDoc comments are used to document the class and its purpose. They serve as the foundation for professional code documentation.
//JavaDoc Annotations - Tags such as @author and @version provide metadata about the class and help maintain traceability as the system evolves.
//Key Requirements
//Create a Java class that represents the application entry point.
//Implement the main() method using the correct signature.
//Print a welcome message to the console.
//Display the application name and version information.
//Use JavaDoc comments to document the class and its intent.
//Ensure the program executes and terminates without errors.
//Key Benefits
//Clear and predictable application startup behavior
//Single, well-defined execution entry point
//Improved debuggability during early development
